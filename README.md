# Welcome to my POST-ATHON project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This system solves the "blind spot" in modern logistics: the inability of current tracking systems to account for external variables like weather and traffic congestion. Unlike traditional systems that only provide reactive status updates, this platform uses Python-based predictive modeling to proactively warn users of potential delays before they occur.

## 🧠 Key Features
#### 🔮 Predictive Intelligence (Conceptual)
- Uses Python-based predictive modeling logic to analyze:
- Historical delivery patterns
- External variables such as weather and traffic
- Calculates a Delay Probability to indicate the likelihood of delivery delays.
#### ⏱ Dynamic ETA Recalculation
- Demonstrates logic for adjusting delivery timelines dynamically:
- Revised ETA = Original ETA + External Delay Factors
#### 🛣️Route Visualization:
- UI-based geospatial tracking for routes such as Hyderabad → Vijayawada → Guntur.
#### 📬Modern India Post–Inspired UI:
- Clean, localized, and responsive interface focused on usability.

Ensures transparency by clearly communicating updated delivery estimates to users.
